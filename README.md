<h1>My Algorithms and Data Structures Learning Project</h1>
<p>Welcome to my personal learning project! 🚀</p>
<p>This repo is where I’m tackling algorithm and data structure problems, tracking my progress, and noting down what I’ve learned. The goal is to solve problems every day, improve my coding skills, and share my journey along the way.</p>
<h2>Why Am I Doing This?</h2>
<p>I’ve decided to take a deep dive into algorithms and data structures to:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Sharpen my problem-solving skills</strong> 💡</li>
    <li><strong>Understand key concepts</strong> that will help in technical interviews and real-world applications 🛠️</li>
    <li><strong>Improve my coding speed and efficiency</strong> ⏱️</li>
</ul>
<p>The idea is to work on problems <strong>daily</strong>, document my solutions, and <strong>share</strong> my progress with anyone who’s interested. This is as much for me to track my learning as it is for anyone else looking to learn alongside me!</p>
<h2>What’s Inside?</h2>
<p>In this project, I’m solving problems across various topics, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Basic Data Structures</strong>: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues</li>
    <li><strong>Advanced Data Structures</strong>: Trees, Graphs, HashMaps</li>
    <li><strong>Algorithms</strong>: Sorting, Searching, Dynamic Programming</li>
    <li><strong>Other Concepts</strong>: Recursion, Backtracking, Greedy Algorithms, String Manipulation</li>
</ul>
<h2>My Goal</h2>
<p>My goal is to:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Learn consistently</strong>: I aim to solve at least one problem every day.</li>
    <li><strong>Document the journey</strong>: For each problem, I’ll explain my thought process, the approach I took, and any challenges I faced.</li>
    <li><strong>Improve over time</strong>: Each day, I want to get better at solving problems and writing clean, efficient code.</li>
</ul>
