<h1>Divide and Conquer Algorithm</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
    The **Divide and Conquer** algorithm is a problem-solving strategy that involves breaking down a large problem into smaller subproblems, solving each subproblem recursively, and combining the results to solve the original problem.
</p>

<h2>Steps of Divide and Conquer</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Divide:</strong> Split the problem into smaller, more manageable subproblems.</li>
    <li><strong>Conquer:</strong> Solve each subproblem recursively. If the subproblem is small enough, solve it directly.</li>
    <li><strong>Combine:</strong> Combine the solutions of the subproblems to solve the original problem.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Example</h2>
<p>
    A classic example is **Merge Sort**. In merge sort, the array is recursively divided into halves, each half is sorted, and then the sorted halves are merged to produce the final sorted array.
</p>

<h2>Advantages</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Reduces the complexity of large problems by solving smaller problems.</li>
    <li>Often leads to more efficient algorithms (e.g., merge sort, quick sort).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
    Divide and Conquer is an effective algorithmic strategy used in many efficient algorithms, particularly in sorting, searching, and optimization problems. By breaking problems into smaller subproblems, it makes complex tasks easier to handle and solve.
